# Purpose

## Is it reasonable or possible to have mobile first media query strategy?

use node 20.x

https://griffel.js.org/react/api/create-dom-renderer (use this to perhaps sort the queries?)


note: was unable to get media queries to stack using mobile first strategy if queries have value of 300px and 1024px or example.
however, was able to get some decent range using rem 0 - 100
